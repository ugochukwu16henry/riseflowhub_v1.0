⚖️ 1️⃣ LEGAL & OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
You are building a startup studio / tech venture builder, not just an agency.
🔹 Step 1: Register the Company
Best structure:
Private Limited Company (Ltd) Why:
Professional
Can bring investors
Can give shares
Limits liability
You can register in:
Nigeria (CAC) for operations
Later add U.S./UK entity for global payments & investors
🔹 Step 2: Ownership Structure (Early Stage)
Since you are founder + tech brain:
Role
Equity (Example)
Henry (Founder & Tech Lead)
50–60%
Co-founder (Operations/Business)
10–20%
Marketing Lead
5–10%
Product/Design Lead
5–10%
Future Employee Pool (ESOP)
10–15% reserved
💡 You don’t give all at once. Use vesting.
🔹 Step 3: Vesting Rule (Very Important)
To avoid people leaving with shares:
4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
Meaning:
If someone leaves before 1 year → gets nothing
Shares unlock gradually over 4 years
🔹 Step 4: Legal Documents You Need
Document
Purpose
Founder Agreement
Defines ownership & roles
NDA
Protects ideas
Service Agreement
For clients
Terms of Use
Platform protection
Privacy Policy
Data protection law
Equity Vesting Agreement
