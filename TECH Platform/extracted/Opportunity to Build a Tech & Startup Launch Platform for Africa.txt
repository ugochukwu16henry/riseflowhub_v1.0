Opportunity to Build a Tech & Startup Launch Platform for Africa
Hello [Name],
I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m building something ambitious, meaningful, and long-term, and you came to mind as someone who might be a great fit to grow it with me.
I am launching a platform focused on helping African entrepreneurs, small business owners, and people with strong ideas turn those ideas into real, functional businesses through technology, structure, and marketing. Many talented people have vision but lack the technical team, business guidance, or digital platform to bring their ideas to life. This is the gap we are stepping in to solve.
The platform will support entrepreneurs by:• Turning ideas into websites, software, and apps• Providing business structuring and guidance• Offering branding and marketing support• Creating a system where clients can track their project progress through a dashboard• Showcasing promising businesses to increase visibility, opportunities, and potential investment
This is not just a tech agency — the goal is to build a startup launch ecosystem that helps ideas move from concept to real, growing businesses.
Right now, I am in the building phase. I will be directly involved in development, strategy, consulting, and operations at the early stage, using my technical and business knowledge to lay the foundation. But this vision is bigger than one person, and I am looking for committed people who want to build something impactful from the ground up.
I’m inviting you to consider coming in at this early stage as part of the core team. As we grow, these roles will evolve into formal leadership positions such as co-founder roles, department leads, and executive positions depending on strengths and contributions.
In the beginning, this will require sacrifice, commitment, and a long-term mindset. We are not just looking for immediate income — we are building something that can create bigger opportunities, stability, and influence for all of us in the future. The focus now is on structure, delivery, and building a strong foundation.
If you’re interested, I’d love to schedule a conversation to share the full vision, the structure, and how your skills could fit into this journey.
Let’s build something that truly creates opportunities and impact.
