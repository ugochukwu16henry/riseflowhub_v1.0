5️⃣ PITCH TO INVESTORS (SHORT VERSION)
Here’s your concept pitch:
AfriLaunch Hub is a tech-enabled startup launch platform helping African entrepreneurs turn ideas into real businesses.
We provide website and app development, business structuring, and marketing support in one ecosystem.
Many African founders lack access to technical teams, business guidance, and digital visibility. We bridge that gap.
Our platform allows entrepreneurs to track their projects, collaborate with our team, and grow their businesses while we earn through service fees and equity in high-potential startups.
Our vision is to become Africa’s leading digital launchpad for emerging businesses.
