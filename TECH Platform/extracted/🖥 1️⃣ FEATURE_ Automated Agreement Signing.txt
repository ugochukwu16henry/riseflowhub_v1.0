🖥 1️⃣ FEATURE: Automated Agreement Signing
Goal: Allow clients, partners, or co-founders to read, sign, and store agreements digitally within the platform. Super Admin can track, manage, and download all signed agreements.
🔹 Workflow Overview
Agreement Created
Admin uploads or selects a template (NDA, MOU, Terms of Use, Co-Founder Agreement).
System converts it into a PDF or interactive form.
Agreement Assigned
Super Admin assigns agreement to a user (Client, Co-founder, Team member).
User Reads & Signs
User views agreement in their dashboard modal.
Confirms “I have read and agree” and signs (typed name or e-signature).
System Stores & Tracks
Signed PDF stored in database/cloud (AWS S3 / Cloudinary).
Super Admin dashboard shows:
Signed / Pending / Overdue status
Download link
Audit logs (date, IP, user)
Optional Notifications
Reminder emails to users who haven’t signed within X days.
Confirmation emails after signing.
